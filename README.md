# Habitua-te Ionic

In order to respond to the different kind of requests performed within the app, it was better to make a REST API. It was built using SQLAlchemy to deal with the Database and Flask to deal with the calls.

Chose _Angular_ because it is a frontend framework which remains one of the best solutions for web development. It served to extend the knowledge on frontend frameworks and languages.

## Auth Module

The main purpose of this module is to check if the user had already logged in in the app, preventing the user to login every time he opens the app. It also generates API Keys for the current user.

## API Service

This module is exclusively used to make API calls and return data from the Database. It processes all requests from the app.
