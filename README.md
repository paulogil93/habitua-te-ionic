# Habitua-te Ionic

Ionic is a complete open-source SDK for hybrid mobile app development. It's cross-platform which means we can build apps for native Android, iOS and Web from a singl codebase. Had the idea to develop this app for iOS and Android but soon abandoned the idea due to high price of Apple Developer Account :(

## Angular

</p>

Chose _Angular_ because it is a frontend framework which remains one of the best solutions for web development. It served to extend the knowledge on frontend frameworks and languages.

## Auth Module

The main purpose of this module is to check if the user had already logged in in the app, preventing the user to login every time he opens the app. It also generates API Keys for the current user.

## API Service

This module is exclusively used to make API calls and return data from the Database. It processes all requests from the app.
